TESTIMONIALS

Creative Decorative Stamped Concrete Client
	They responded very timely, had some great design suggestions (which I took) and gave me the estimate right away and gave me a list of many prior customers who had the same type of work done for me to check out. Once the contract was signed and a starting date agreed on they showed up on time and finished the major work within the week. Paul knows his business and they did excellent work. I would definately recommend Alexander and Sons and I will have them do any additional work I need.
